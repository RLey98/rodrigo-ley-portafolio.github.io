      <h2>Introducción</h2>
      <p>
        La empresa Interconnect desea pronosticar su tasa de cancelación de
        clientes. Si se descubre que un usuario o usuaria planea irse, se le
        ofrecerán códigos promocionales y opciones de planes especiales. Por lo
        tanto se busca analizar los datos contractuales, personales y de uso de
        servicios de los clientes que el equipo de marketing de Interconnect ha
        recopilado para identificar patrones que influyan en la tasa de
        cancelación. Con esto, la empresa podrá anticipar qué clientes tienen
        mayor riesgo de darse de baja y tomar medidas preventivas.
      </p>

      <h2>Objetivo</h2>
      <p>
        Desarrollar un modelo predictivo capaz de predecir la tasa de
        cancelación de clientes de Interconnect usando métricas de evaluación,
        como principal AUC-ROC que sea igual o mayor a 0.88 y exactitud como
        secundaria.

        The data being inputted into the sheet was probably the cleanest data I
        could use for a project. Each entry had 4 components: DateTime,
        Notification, Song and Artist, and Category. The first step was to
        remove Notification and Category since they are not relevant to the
        project. Then, I split DateTime into separate Date and Time columns
        using the Split function. The same split function was used for Song and
        Artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        While doing a spot check of the data, I realized that the Pixel was
        sometimes double-reading the song, creating a duplicate entry. To
        address this, a Duplicate Indicator was added, which would be set to
        true if the same song came up less than 2 minutes apart from each other.
        To make analytics easier, Day of the Week and Hour columns were also
        added.

      <h2>Data Analytics</h2>
      <h3>as of April 23,2023 (about 90 Days of Data)</h3>
      <p>
        During the data collection process of my music data, we were able to
        collect over 4200 data points. However, after cleaning and removing
        duplicates, we ended up with over 3000 true data points. The duplicate
        rate was higher than anticipated, with about 26% of the collected data
        being duplicates. It was interesting to observe that most of the
        duplicates occurred on weekends between 4pm and midnight, which makes
        sense because that was when I listened to the most music.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked at the most listened-to songs and artists. It was interesting
        to see that Dua Lipa was almost an outlier, having a 40% increase
        compared to the next most listened-to artist. This was due to two of her
        songs being in my top ten most listened-to songs.
      </p>

      <img src="imagen4.jpg" alt="Descripción de imagen 4" />
      <p>
        Next, we looked at the frequency of artist and songs. This was because I
        am known to listen to songs on repeat sometimes or get into a groove
        where I only listen to one artist. Most songs and artists had a
        frequency of one, only being heard once, with a frequency of 10 and
        under being over 90% of the data for both songs and artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then looked at the DateTime information and found that Friday,
        Saturday, and Sunday were the days that I listened to the most music,
        with an average of 40 songs logged on each of those days, while the
        other days had an average of around 30 song.
      </p>

      <p>
        I made a heat map of my music listening habits throughout the week. The
        data showed that I listen to music consistently every day, with the most
        activity on weekends from 7 PM to midnight. I also listen to a
        significant amount of music on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the
        afternoons.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the heat map, it seems that music plays an important role in my
        daily routine. The consistent pattern of music consumption suggests that
        I rely on music to regulate my mood or energy levels throughout the day.
        Additionally, the peak in music consumption during the weekends in the
        evenings suggests that I use music as a way to relax and escape.
